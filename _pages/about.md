Dr Read is a Lecturer in Biomedical Computation at the University of Sydney, in the School of Computer Science. 

Dr Read's group specialises in understanding biological systems through computational, mathematical and statistical approaches. This is ever more relevant as high-throughput and imaging technologies transform BioMedicine into a more data-centric field. Our focus is primarily on immunological systems, and the microbial communities that inhabit the gut.

Dr Read was awarded my PhD in 2012 by the University of York, UK, for work advancing the investigation of biological systems through simulation and statistics. He had a brief foray into swarm robotics whilst at York. He moved to the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre in 2013 as an independent researcher, and joined the Centre for Food Enginomics in 2018 before my appointment as Lecturer in 2019.
