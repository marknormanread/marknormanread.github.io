I am a Lecturer in Biomedical Computation at the University of Sydney, in the School of Computer Science. 

My group specialises in understanding biological systems through computational, mathematical and statistical approaches. 
This is ever more relevant as high-throughput and imaging technologies transform BioMedicine into a more data-centric field. 
Our focus is primarily on immunological systems, and the microbial communities that inhabit the gut.

I was awarded my PhD in 2012 by the University of York, UK, for work advancing the investigation of biological systems through simulation and statistics. 
I had a brief foray into swarm robotics whilst at York. 
I then moved to the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre in 2013 as an independent researcher, and joined the Centre for Food Enginomics in 2018 before my appointment as Lecturer in 2019.

## CV

You can find a (relatively) [recent version of my CV here](http://marknormanread.github.io/pubs/MarkRead_CV.pdf). This is an academic CV (not a resume) - it is a relatively full listing of my academic activities.

"You will find that both shock and common sense are soluble in a sufficient concentration of money." - Adrian Tchaikovsky, one of my favourite authors. 

"All discoveries, all great achievements, have been made by men who delighted in their work." - Sawyer 1943. Found this in a book making the case that there's no excuse for bad teaching. 

“An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made.” – Niels Bohr

“If we knew what it was we were doing, it wouldn’t be called ‘research’, would it?” – Albert Einstein

“Now, like all my great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it.” – Zapp Brannigan
