The [Immune Dynamics official website](https://immunedynamics.io/) has gone live!

Immune Dynamics is a collaborative research initiative between myself and Sydney Cytometry (particularly Dr Thomas Ashhurst).
Together, we develop technology platforms, often founded in machine learning and data science, to advance biomedical study through high-throughout cytometry quantifications.
This is a highly interdisciplinary endeavour, and bags of fun to drive forwards.

Our outputs include
[Spectre](https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/), 
[ChronoClust](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705119300796), 
[TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM) and 
[ParetoBench](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab038).
