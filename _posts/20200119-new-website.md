I've been hosting a website myself for years, organising personal domains and website hosting services.
A nice experience, but far more complicated than I need.
GitHub pages (github.io) can host impressive looking sites with more ease, for free.
So here we are.

I'm still updating the contents, and this may take a few days yet.
But so far I am impressed, simple GitHub operation and all content is written in markdown.
