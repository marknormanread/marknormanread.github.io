Spectre is an R package that combines many useful, both otherwise not easily compatible, tools from cytometry into one integrated framework.
It makes high-quality and complete cytometry analysis seamless and convenient. 

The endeavour is led by Dr. Thomas Ashhurst, a cytometry specialist with a keen understanding of the role of data science in advancing immunological investigation.
He and I have worked closely together for several years and have generated a number of transformative analytical solutions: see the [Immune Dynamics website](https://immunedynamics.io/) for further details.
