The [Spectre toolkit publication](https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.24350) is now in print!

Spectre is an R package that combines many useful, both otherwise not easily compatible, tools from cytometry into one integrated framework.
It makes high-quality and complete cytometry analysis seamless and convenient. 

The above image is a nice depiction of what supervised machine learning learning does in 'transfer learning' (taking labels from one cell population and applying it to unlabelled data).

The endeavour is led by Dr. Thomas Ashhurst, a cytometry specialist with a keen understanding of the role of data science in advancing immunological investigation.
He and I have worked closely together for several years and have generated a number of transformative analytical solutions: see the [Immune Dynamics website](https://immunedynamics.io/) for further details.
